Here is a simple toy plugin to play with canvas and perform some convolutions on images.
The test/ folder contains some example of use (and bugs!).

TODO:
  * complete border handling with more options
  * handle alpha channel better
  * allowing chaining
  * add more kernels (Gaussian(n), blur(n)...)
  
  
BUGS:
  * Bootstrap thumbnail bug
